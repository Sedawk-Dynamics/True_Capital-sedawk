    title: `Home Loan in India: A First-Time Buyer's Checklist`,
    summary: `Buying your first home? Before you apply, understand the essentials — down payment (usually 10–25%), your eligibility based on income and CIBIL score, and the difference between fixed and floating interest rates. This guide walks you through the documents lenders ask for, how to compare offers beyond just the headline rate, and the role of processing fees and prepayment terms in your total cost.`,
    body: [
      `A home loan is likely the biggest financial commitment you will make, so preparation pays off. Start by checking your CIBIL score — a score above 750 typically unlocks the best interest rates. Lenders assess your repayment capacity using your net monthly income and existing obligations, so clearing small loans before applying can improve eligibility.`,
      `Decide between a fixed and floating rate. Floating rates move with the RBI repo rate and are usually lower to begin with, while fixed rates offer predictability. Many borrowers in India prefer floating rates for long tenures because they tend to average out lower over time.`,
      `Look beyond the advertised rate. Processing fees, legal and valuation charges, and prepayment conditions all affect your real cost. Always ask for the full sanction letter and read the fine print on reset clauses.`,
      `Finally, keep your documents ready: identity and address proof, income proof (salary slips or ITRs), bank statements, and property papers. Organised paperwork speeds up approval significantly — and a good consultant can help you present the strongest possible application.`,
    ],

  {
    cat: "Credit Score Tips", thumb: "t2", ic: "trending",
    title: `7 Habits That Quietly Improve Your CIBIL Score`,
    summary: `Your credit score decides not just whether you get a loan, but at what rate. The good news: improving it is mostly about consistent habits. Pay every EMI and credit-card bill on time, keep your credit utilisation under 30%, avoid multiple loan applications in a short window, and maintain a healthy mix of secured and unsecured credit. Small, steady actions compound into a strong score.`,
    body: [
      `Payment history is the single biggest factor in your CIBIL score. Even one missed EMI or late credit-card payment can pull your score down for months. Set up auto-debit or reminders so you never miss a due date.`,
      `Credit utilisation — how much of your card limit you use — should ideally stay below 30%. If you regularly hit your limit, request a limit increase or spread spending across cards rather than maxing one out.`,
      `Avoid applying for several loans or cards in a short period. Each application triggers a "hard enquiry" that can temporarily lower your score and signals credit hunger to lenders.`,
      `A balanced mix of secured loans (home, auto) and unsecured credit (personal loan, cards), managed responsibly, demonstrates that you can handle different types of debt. Keep old, well-managed accounts open — a longer credit history works in your favour.`,
      `Finally, check your credit report at least once a year for errors. Incorrect entries or accounts you never opened can drag your score down, and disputing them is free and worthwhile.`,

    title: `Working Capital for MSMEs: CC, OD or Term Loan?`,
    summary: `Cash flow is the lifeblood of any small business. Choosing the right credit facility — Cash Credit, Overdraft, or a Term Loan — can make managing it far easier. CC and OD suit recurring, short-term needs where you pay interest only on what you use, while a term loan fits one-time capital expenditure with predictable EMIs. Here's how to decide.`,
    body: [
      `MSMEs often blur the line between short-term liquidity and long-term investment. Matching the facility to the need keeps your interest costs lean and your books healthy.`,
      `Cash Credit (CC) is secured against stock and receivables and works as a revolving limit — ideal for businesses with seasonal inventory or working-capital cycles. You pay interest only on the amount drawn, not the full limit.`,
      `An Overdraft (OD) lets you withdraw beyond your account balance up to a sanctioned limit. It is flexible for short, unpredictable gaps, and like CC, interest applies only to the used portion.`,
      `A Term Loan is better suited to buying machinery, expanding premises, or other one-time capital expenditure. It comes with a fixed tenure and EMI, making budgeting straightforward.`,
      `A common strategy is to combine them: a term loan for assets and a CC/OD limit for day-to-day operations. An advisor can help structure the right mix and connect you with lenders offering favourable MSME rates and government-backed schemes like CGTMSE.`,

    title: `Loan Balance Transfer: When It Actually Saves You Money`,
    summary: `A balance transfer moves your existing loan to a new lender offering a lower interest rate — potentially cutting your EMI or tenure. But it isn't always worth it. Factor in processing fees, the remaining tenure, and prepayment charges on your old loan. As a rule of thumb, a transfer makes most sense early in the loan when the interest component is high and the rate difference is meaningful.`,
    body: [
      `A balance transfer can be a powerful tool, but the savings depend on timing and the true rate gap. The earlier you are in your loan tenure, the more interest you stand to save, because the early years carry the heaviest interest load.`,
      `Calculate the net benefit: subtract the new lender's processing fee and any foreclosure charges on your existing loan from your projected interest savings. If the rate difference is less than around 0.5%, the transfer often isn't worth the effort and cost.`,
      `Many lenders sweeten transfers with top-up loans at home-loan rates — useful if you also need extra funds. But don't let a top-up tempt you into borrowing more than you need.`,
      `Read the new sanction terms carefully, especially reset clauses on floating rates. A headline rate that jumps after a few months can erase your savings. A consultant can run the numbers across lenders so you transfer only when it genuinely pays.`,
    ],

    title: `Why Every Borrower Should Think About Insurance`,
    summary: `Taking a loan increases your financial responsibility — and a sudden illness, accident or loss of income can put repayment at risk. Term life and health insurance act as a safety net, protecting your family from inheriting your debt and shielding your savings from medical emergencies. For loans, a pure term cover is usually far better value than bundled loan-protection products.`,
    body: [
      `When you take on a loan, you take on an obligation that outlives most short-term disruptions. Insurance ensures that an unexpected event doesn't turn into a financial crisis for your family.`,
      `A term life policy equal to your outstanding liabilities (plus a buffer for living expenses) means your dependents are never burdened with your debt. Term plans are inexpensive relative to the cover they provide and are the most cost-effective form of life insurance.`,
      `Health insurance is equally important. A single hospitalisation can wipe out years of savings; a good family floater policy protects the funds you would otherwise use for EMIs.`,
      `Be cautious with loan-protection or "reducing cover" products bundled at the time of borrowing — they are often costlier than a standalone term plan for the same protection. Compare independently before you sign.`,
      `The goal is simple: borrow with confidence, knowing that life's uncertainties won't derail your repayments or your family's security.`,

    title: `Reading Your Credit Report: What Lenders Actually See`,
    summary: `Your credit report is more than a number. Lenders scrutinise your repayment track record, the number of active loans, recent enquiries, and any settled or written-off accounts. Knowing what they look for helps you fix red flags before applying — like an old settled account or an error you never noticed. Here's how to read your report like a lender does.`,
    body: [
      `A credit report tells your financial story in detail, and lenders read it closely before approving any loan. Understanding it puts you in control.`,
      `The account summary lists all your loans and cards — active and closed — with their payment status. "Settled" or "written-off" tags are serious red flags; if you see one you've since cleared, get the status updated to "closed".`,
